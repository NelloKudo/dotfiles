### Installation

Please backup your existing config before installing!

Made it simple this time:

```
git clone https://github.com/NelloKudo/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### GTK Settings

You can use [nwg-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look) to set GTK Theme, Icons, Fonts for apps etc:
- Arch Linux has the package in their repos
- Fedora users can use this [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/tofik/nwg-shell/)

### Credits
- [ziap's dotfiles](https://github.com/ziap/dotfiles): pretty much what I started from for this config ;)
